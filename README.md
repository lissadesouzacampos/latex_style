# latex_style
For plots with latex style: title, labels and ticks with the compatible fonts. 

Working in Python and using matplotlib, one case use the stylesheet "latex.mplstyle". To learn how to write and use a stylesheet, check [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html).

Working in Mathematica, one can use the LatexPlot function by importing the package "LatexPlot.m". The file "LatexPlotUsage" describes its usage. It has two dependencies: [MaTeX](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/9355/) and [CustomTicks](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/5599/).
